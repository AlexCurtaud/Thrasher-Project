# Thrasher Project

## Description
A website Thrasher Magazine, made only with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
I made it for a JavaScript course at my campus and at home. There is still much to be done.

## Goal
My point here was to train JavaScript, CSS and HTML doing something that resonate with me.
It made me trust more my capabilities in CSS and JavaScript. I can now manipulate the DOM more freely, manipulate the design in a easier manner.

## Current State
Work in progress.


## Author note
If you want to have a look you can just clone the Repo and run it onto live server for example.

Have a nice day !
