# Thrasher Project
--- 
## Description
A website Thrasher Magazine, made only with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
I made it for a JavaScript course at my campus and at home. There is still much to be done.

## Goal
The point here is to train my skilss in JavaScript, CSS and HTML doing something that resonate with me.
It made me trust more my capabilities in CSS and JavaScript. I can now manipulate the DOM more freely & manipulate the design in a easier manner.

## Current State
### Minimum feature missing
- Suppress Post
- Adding / Suppressing Video in Video Gallery
- Mobile Responsivness (did it the other way around).
### State
Work in progress.

## Organisation
No MVC model here, it is just pure html/css/javascript.
I tried to comment my code as good as possible so everyone can easily land on the project.

## Author note
A sober website from a well-known magazine of the skate/urban culture. Way more to be done.
If you want to have a look you can just clone the Repo and run it onto live server for example.

Have a nice day !
